        <h2> Maroon 5</h2>
        <p>I really like <b>Adam Lavine</b>, he has <b>such a good voice!</b> 
            I enjoy their hits and I enjoy their more underground music. 
            But I <b>especially</b> bump their hits of course, like anyone else would. 
            But generally they have more feel good songs that I enjoy.
