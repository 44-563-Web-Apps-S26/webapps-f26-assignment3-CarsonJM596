        <h1>Carson's Favorite Location</h1>
        <p>
            Over the last summer I went to Tybee Island in Georgia, and the food was to die for.
            Not only was the food great, but the location is beautiful with a lot of untold stories to find there.
            The beach was beautiful and the wildlife was up close, and worth the trip to see.
            If you do ever go, make sure to go to the beach and go to the crab shack for some good food.
